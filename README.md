# java-workPunchTime
Work/Break time tracker. Inspired to display study/not-studying time for productivity purpose

Created by: Anthony Narlock

Purpose: Create a GUI that tracks user information including:
	Punch in and Punch out system, marking when work has begun and when work ends. (Also would count the amount of time the user was in "break mode")
	Create time markings, to show the exact time that the user punched in, or punched out, took a break, etc.
	All information for specific user is to be loaded via another file that is stored on the computer.

Reason for dev: I started a new type of studying and I wanted to track the amount of time I spent studying and the amound of time that I was taking breaks. I think that other people may find this useful as well!

Optional addition: Adding the gross "hourly" rate of a user could also display how much money that person makes when they are punched in. This could also lead to multiple other calculations as well in the future.
